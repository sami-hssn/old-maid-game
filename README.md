Have you ever wanted to play your favorite childhood card game but due to assignments and other commitments, none of your friends are available? Why not play Old Maid against a robot!

## **Context:**

A fun little assignment for my Introduction to Python Class. This project allowed me to get more comfortable with list methods, learn how to work with the random library and taught me the basics on creating a deck for future card games. I honestly didn't know what Old Maid was until this assignment but it was fun developing this simple card game.


## **Objective:**

Old maid is a card game where the goal is to remove all pairs from the deck and avoid having the odd queen card as your final card. 


## **Rules:**

The deck is split in half and shuffled among the two players, except one of the four queen cards is removed. Each player will then look through their cards and remove all rank pairs they can find (suit doesn't matter). The first player will then ask for one of their opponent's cards to take in attempt to create a pair. Then their opponent will ask for one of their cards to try and make a pair. This will keep going on until one card is remaining, the final queen card. Whoever has the last queen card is the loser.
